****To avoid conflicts, each member should work in their own branch.****

2️⃣ Workflow:

  1) Clone the repo:
      git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git

  2) Create a new branch for your feature:
      git checkout -b feature-branch-name

  3) Work on your code and commit changes:
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added feature XYZ"

  4) Push your branch:
  
    git push origin feature-branch-name

   5) Open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub.

4️⃣ Code Review via Pull Requests

   1 Once a feature is ready, open a Pull Request (PR).
   2 Other team members review the code and leave comments.
   3 Once approved, merge the PR into the main branch.

5️⃣ Handle Merge Conflicts

If multiple people edit the same file, conflicts may happen. Resolve them by:

1) Pulling the latest changes:
  git pull origin main

2) Manually fixing conflicts.
3) Adding and committing changes:
    git add .
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"

4) Pushing the resolved branch:

git push origin feature-branch-name
